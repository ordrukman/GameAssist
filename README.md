# GameAssist
Android app, assisting to manage your game.

A self-learn project using and learnning android studio application.
I create an app called GameAssist. Created while implementing the principles of OOP and app design.
The App purpose is to manage tournaments or few matchups games between an unlimited number of players.

App Description:

First the user insert the players names one by one:

After clicking on the submit button all the possible matchups between those players appeared:

The user inserts game-winners for every matchup and clicks apply, then when clicking on the results button the app present the players ranked by their number of victories and the number of played games for each player:

Of course, the user can go back and edit the details and the app will update as well.
Moreover, the app supports all possible errors (inserting two players with the same name and more...) and responds accordingly.
The app also requires entering a minimum number of winners so that all players have played at least one game, which allows the user to watch the results screen before all the games have been played.

The APK file contains the app, so feel free to download it and try it by yourself.
Don't forget to change your phone language to English if necessary :)

While programming the app I used several UI tools that android studio suggests, RecyclerView, ListView, CardView, etc'...

Have Fun!
